**Describe the bug and the expected behaviour**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**Is it a bug in signing or in the helpers?**
If it's an issue with helpers, please specify which one.

**To Reproduce**
Help us reproduce.
Include any relevant code.
Point to where you are having issues with links.
Give us a failing test.
In all cases make sure to include at least a source PDF that you are trying and failing to sign.
To let us easily take a look, it would help if you also include a resulting document (thou probably corrupted one).
